IMPORTANT! PLEASE READ THIS FILE EVERY TIME YOU LOGIN TO CHECK FOR UPDATES! 
Do not merge onto the main unless your pull request passes the CI pipeline. You can confirm by pressing Actions and then looking for your request (should be at the top) and seeing if there is a green tick.

***[How to GitHub!]***

Goal: everyone builds and tests code locally, opens a Pull request from their own branch after they push their code to it, CI runs (in GitHub actions), <mark>we only merge to main when CI is green.</mark>
